# Welcome to GenAI Bootcamp! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! Welcome to what's going to be an exciting few weeks together.

## What You're Going to Learn

You're here to learn GenAI, and we're going to do it by actually building stuff. No fluff, no theory-heavy lectures - just hands-on work that'll get you comfortable with:

**Working with AI Models**
- OpenAI's GPT models for text generation
- Anthropic's Claude for reasoning tasks  
- HuggingFace models you can run locally
- Meta's LLaMA for open-source alternatives

**Prompt Engineering That Works**
- Writing prompts that get consistent results
- Few-shot examples and chain-of-thought reasoning
- Function calling to make AI use tools
- Guardrails to keep responses on track

**RAG Systems (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- Build chatbots that can answer questions from your PDFs
- Use LangChain and LlamaIndex frameworks
- Work with vector databases like Pinecone and FAISS
- Make AI that stays up-to-date with your data

**AI Agents**
- Create agents that can research topics for you
- Build multi-agent teams with LangGraph and CrewAI
- Give AI access to tools and watch it work
- Orchestrate complex workflows automatically

**Real Applications People Can Use**
- Interactive dashboards with Streamlit
- REST APIs with FastAPI for production use
- Deploy everything to AWS using Bedrock and SageMaker
- Build full-stack AI apps from scratch

You'll touch tools like Docker for deployment, Git for version control, and Jupyter notebooks for experimentation. By the end, you'll know the whole AI development stack.

## How This Works

Each module has lessons and exercises. Do the exercises - that's where the real learning happens. Submit your work in the `submissions/your-name/` folder so we can give you feedback.

Don't worry if you get stuck. That's normal. Ask questions, experiment, break things. That's how you learn.

## Before You Start

Make sure you've done the setup in `setup-guide.md`. Seriously, do it now. Nothing's more frustrating than hitting environment issues when you're trying to learn something new.

## Ready?

Let's start with `0-intro` and work our way through. By the end, you'll have built some pretty cool AI applications.

See you in the modules! ðŸš€
