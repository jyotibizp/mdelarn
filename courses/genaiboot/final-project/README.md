# Final Project 🚀

Welcome to the **Final Project** for the Generative AI Bootcamp!

This is your chance to bring together everything you’ve learned:
- LLM fundamentals (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, LLaMA)
- Prompt Engineering
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Vector DBs)
- Agentic AI (LangGraph, CrewAI)
- Applications (Streamlit, AWS Bedrock/SageMaker, API services)

---

## 🎯 Objective
Build a **working end-to-end Generative AI application** that solves a real-world problem.

Some example project ideas:
- **Chatbot with memory + RAG** (docs, PDFs, websites)
- **Agentic Research Assistant** using LangGraph/CrewAI
- **Streamlit App** for content generation or workflow automation
- **Custom Vector Search + RAG** pipeline for niche datasets
- **AWS Bedrock/SageMaker Deployment** of your LLM pipeline

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `template/` → starter code to help you bootstrap
- `submissions/<mentee_name>/final-project/` → your working project lives here

---

## ✅ Deliverables
1. **Code** — well structured, readable, modular (inside your own `submissions/<name>/final-project/`).
2. **README.md** — explain:
   - Problem statement
   - Solution approach
   - Tools/technologies used
   - How to run your project (commands, setup)
3. **Demo** — either:
   - Streamlit app  
   - Notebook demo  
   - API endpoint demo (FastAPI/Flask)

---

## 🏆 Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality (working end-to-end)
- Correct usage of concepts taught (LLMs, RAG, agents, etc.)
- Code readability + modularity
- Creativity & real-world relevance

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Copy the `template/` folder into your submission path:
   ```bash
   cp -r final-project/template submissions/<your_name>/final-project
