## Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Prompting"
**Objectives:**
  - Differentiate between zero-shot and few-shot
  - Understand when to use each
  - Practice creating few-shot prompts

## 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

No examples are given. The model relies on its general knowledge.

> “Translate to French: I have a red bike.”

## 2. Few-Shot Prompting

Give the model 1–3 examples before the task.

> “Translate to French:
> - I have a dog → J’ai un chien
> - It is raining → Il pleut
> - I have a red bike →”

## 3. Use Cases

Few-shot improves:
- Classification
- Translation
- Structured outputs

## 4. Exercise

Convert a 0-shot sentiment classification prompt into a few-shot version.

## 5. Summary

Few-shot = context + examples. Use it when task structure matters.
