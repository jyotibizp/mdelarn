## Chain-of-Thought Prompting
**Objectives:**
  - Understand CoT for reasoning tasks
  - Compare outputs with vs without CoT
  - Write your own CoT prompts

## 1. What is Chain-of-Thought?

Ask the model to “think out loud” before giving the answer.

> "Let's think step-by-step."

## 2. Example

### Without CoT:
> Q: If I have 3 red balls and 2 blue balls, how many balls do I have?  
> A: 5

### With CoT:
> Q: I have 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. Let's think step-by-step.  
> A: First, count the red balls: 3. Then blue: 2. Total = 3 + 2 = 5.

## 3. Exercise

Rewrite a math or logic prompt to include CoT.

## 4. Summary

CoT improves reasoning, especially in math, logic, and multi-step problems.
