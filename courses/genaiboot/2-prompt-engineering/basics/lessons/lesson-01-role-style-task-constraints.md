## Prompt Structure: Role, Style, Task, Constraints

**Objectives:**
  - Understand the components of effective prompts
  - Practice using role-play and style adaptation
  - Apply constraints to guide model behavior

## 1. Introduction

Prompting is the art of communicating with LLMs. Clear prompts yield reliable outputs.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 🔹 Role
Define who the assistant is (e.g., expert, teacher, translator).

> “You are a medical doctor explaining diabetes to a teenager.”

### 🔹 Style
Define tone or language style.

> “Respond in a friendly and casual tone.”

### 🔹 Task
Be explicit about what you want the model to do.

> “Summarize this article in 3 bullet points.”

### 🔹 Constraints
Apply limits such as word count, format, or language.

> “Limit the response to 100 words.”

## 3. Examples

### 🎯 Prompt:
> You are a poetic assistant. Write a haiku about autumn. Use a formal tone.

### 💬 Response:
> Leaves fall quietly  
> Crimson whispers touch the ground  
> Autumn breathes its end  

## 4. Exercise

Create a prompt that:
- Defines the assistant as a startup mentor
- Uses a casual tone
- Asks for startup pitch feedback
- Limits response to 3 bullet points

## 5. Summary

The RSTC framework (Role, Style, Task, Constraints) is your prompt blueprint.
