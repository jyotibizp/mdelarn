title: "Prompt Optimization & Evaluation"
duration: 40 min
objectives:
  - Refine prompts to improve output
  - Identify prompt failure patterns
  - Evaluate output quality using metrics
---

## 1. Introduction

Not all prompts are equal. This lesson shows how to optimize prompts for clarity, structure, and reliability.

## 2. Techniques

- Clarify instructions
- Add structure (e.g. bullet points, JSON)
- Reduce ambiguity
- Use scoring models or human feedback

## 3. Evaluation Methods

- Human eval: helpfulness, relevance, factuality
- Automated eval: BLEU, ROUGE, embeddings, etc.
- Custom rubrics

## 4. Exercise

Improve a poorly performing prompt and evaluate outputs.

## 5. Summary

Prompting is iterative. Optimization + evaluation = reliable results.
